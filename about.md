About the author

Paul Quin is a writer, designer and producer of communications, learning materials and language art. After studies at Johns Hopkins, he fell into a job doing publications for the Baltimore Museum and fell in love with type, words and the community of learning. His personal page is [pdquin.com](http://pdquin.com/).

Paul lives in San Francisco with his husband of nearly 20 years, the wearables and home furnishings designer Vince Blaskovich, on-line at [originalvincie.com](http://originalvincie.com/). With the artist Judy Kennedy, they are the parents of the tech/spaces interaction designer Quin Kennedy of New York – some of his work can be seen at [quinkennedy.com](http://quinkennedy.com/).

About this page

WTF gathers the scraps of personal thought and comment along the arc of Paul's working life, including how-tos for designers about geeky things, observations on the cultural and community scene, experiments in writing and design and thoughts on the integrity of language. This page is itself an experiment – in this incarnation, an experiment in using the github idiot file as a blog machine.
